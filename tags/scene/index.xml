      <description>Application of supervised learning techniques on data collected from the U.S. census to help CharityML identify people most likely to donate to their cause.
We first explore the data to learn how the census data is recorded. Next, apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. We then evaluate several supervised learners on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution.</description>

      <description>The goal of this project was to implement four simple motion detection algorithms, run them on short videos, and compare the results. The four algorithms are:
 Simple Background Subtraction Simple Frame Differencing Adaptive Background Subtraction Persistent Frame Differencing  We were required to implement all four in one program and generate, as output, a four-panel frame showing the results of each algorithm, on each video frame, and generate a video of the results.</description>
